Health in England remained relatively stable in the years before the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, with improvments in children's health being offset by a decline in mental health.

"Children and young people" and "Mental health" are both subdomains of the Health Index, which has been developed by the Office for National Statistics to track the changing quality of various indicators of health across the country.

The index also reveals different trends emerging between regions, as health worsened in the North East between 2015 and 2019, but improved in the North West during the same period.

The North East's decline in health was in part caused by a deterioration in risk factors relating to crime, with the index score for this subdomain falling from 96.5 to 89.0. A rise in the score for behavioural risk factors, from 94.3 to 95.5, contributed to the North West's improved health.

The South East has the highest regional Health Index score and saw a considerable imporvement in health associated with economic and working conditions between 2018 and 2019.
