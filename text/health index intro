Health in England remained relatively stable in the years before the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, with improvments in children's health being offset by a decline in mental health.

Children's health and mental health are both subdomains of the Health Index, which has been developed by the Office for National Statistics to track the changing quality of various indicators of health across the country.

The index also reveals different trends emerging between regions, as health worsened in the North East between 2015 and 2019, but improved in the North West during the same period.

Both these movements were in part caused by differences in health outcomes relating crime, with the index score for this subdomain falling from 96.7 to 88.2 in the North East, while rising from 98.6 to 120.9 in the North West.
